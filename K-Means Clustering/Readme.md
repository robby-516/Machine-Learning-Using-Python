# 📊 K-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset

This folder contains a Python implementation of **K-Means Clustering** applied to the Iris dataset. The code includes the clustering process, visualization, and the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

---

## 🛠️ Contents
- Python script for K-Means Clustering on the Iris dataset
- Visualizations of the clustering results and cluster centroids
- Elbow method for determining the optimal number of clusters

---

## 🚀 Requirements  
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:  
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

---

## 📥 Usage  

- Run the Python script to perform K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset.
- The first plot shows the clustering results with the cluster labels and centroids.
- The second plot shows the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## 📚 About the Iris Dataset  

- The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from 3 species of iris flowers, with four features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. This dataset is commonly used for clustering and classification tasks.
- This dataset can be directly loaded from `sklearn.datasets` and used as shown in the program.
